# Registration Form
the project is  about securing a registration web page that was filled with vulnerabilities 
we secured it by the following changes:
- hashing the password.
- changing the value to POST of the HTML form's METHOD attribute to hide sensitive/personal information from the third party.
- adding a Strong password policy
- preventing SQL injection by utilizing parameterized database queries with bound to handle escaping untrusted user input.
